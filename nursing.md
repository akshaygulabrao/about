# Why I left Computer Vision to Pursue Nursing

I majored in Computer Engineering at UC Riverside in 2017. I qualified for the BS + MS graduate program there, and ended up with a MS in Computer Science in 2022. After that I worked for defense contractor (that went out of business) building Automated Target Recognition systems of military vehicles. I ended up getting laid off in October 2024 and have been unemployed since. 

The amount of jobs in Computer Science has reduced drastically from 2022 to 2025. [FRED Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE) for the following reasons (1) Badly enforced H1Bs immigration rules allowing companies to hire immigrants for far cheaper costs than US talent because they can use deportation to extort more hours out of workers, (2) In 2022, the tax code forced all software developers to be classified as capital instead of R&D, meaning that they can't be deducted on taxes making them 30% more expensive, and (3) high interest rates stifle risk-taking in all scenarios given the extremely high cost of failure.

Now, the reason why I think nursing is a better choice is because of the special budget treatment that Medicare gets in the [US Code](https://uscode.house.gov/). In summary, when Congress needs to make the budget work, Medicare is protected, allowing only a 4% cut max. Even during the 4% cut, slightly I contemplated becoming a doctor (assuming I'm smart enough to become one), but am unable to make the discounted cashflows work in my favor due to the high CA state tax rate. I feel like nursing provides a high return relative to the risk (of tuition).
