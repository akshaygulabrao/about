# introduction to the world of voice synthesis

*This is not a serious introduction to voice synthesis. This is my attempt to become familiar with the field.*

Voice synthesis refers to the deep learning task of converting one voice speaking a specific utterance to a different voice. It is significantly easier than face generation because the data has far lower dimensionality. Azzuni et al. published a comprehensive survey of voice cloning, so I will begin there. [^1]

Reading the introduction to they paper, the papers they cite mainly involve TTS speech synthesis, however, I'm mainly interested in speech to speech synthesis. An arxive search of speech synthesis yielded the interesting paper by Quamer et al. [^2] The author uses the CommonVoice dataset.[^3]

I also looked into the Pureformer VC [^4].
