Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR) has a drug named Deramiocel (CAP-1002) to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It's currently in Phase 3 and they are due to release data in a few weeks.

Martin doesn't think the drug works.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a severe X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes a structural cytoskeletal protein in muscle cells named **dystrophin**. 

Skeletal muscles turn nerve signals into force by sliding filaments inside long multinucleated fibers. Force travels both along fibers to tendons and laterally into the surrounding matrix.
Dystrophin sits at the membrane, anchoring the inside (actin) to the outside (extracellular matrix) to protect the cell during contraction.

Each muscle is actually a hierarchy of tissues. The largest group is the whole muscles, which are bundles of fascicles wrapped in **epimysium**. Each fascicle contains a bundle of muslce fibers wrapped in **perimysium**. Each muscle fiber is a single long cell with many nuclei. The membrane is called the **sarcolemma**. **Myofibril** is parallel contractile cables inside fibers. **Sarcomere** are repeating units between **Z-disks**, which is where contraction happens. 

In the sarcomere, there are two types of filaments: a thin filament made of **actin**, and a thick filament made of **myosin**.
