<p>Two novel programs for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). -
selective JAK2V617F JH2 inhibitors. - CALR-targeted degrader antibody
conjugates (DACs)</p>
<p>Market treats them as highly differentiated, first-in-class
approaches for the potential to transform MPN treatment.</p>
<h3 id="context-what-are-myeloproliferative-neoplasms">Context: What are
myeloproliferative neoplasms?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big picture</strong>: MPNs are clonal disorders of
hematopoietic stem cells where a single mutant progenitor keeps
producing too many mature myeloid cells (red cells, platelets, or
granulocytes). The cells still differentiate, so the disease looks
“proliferative” rather than “blastic” like acute leukemia.</li>
<li><strong>Canonical subtypes</strong>: Polycythemia vera (PV) causes
erythrocytosis, essential thrombocythemia (ET) drives thrombocytosis,
and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) scars the marrow so blood formation
shifts to the spleen/liver. Chronic myeloid leukemia is technically an
MPN but is typically discussed separately because of BCR–ABL.</li>
<li><strong>Molecular drivers</strong>: ~95% of PV and ~60% of ET/PMF
cases harbor the JAK2 V617F mutation; others have MPL (thrombopoietin
receptor) or calreticulin (CALR) mutations. All of these keep the
JAK–STAT pathway switched on without cytokine ligand binding.</li>
<li><strong>Clinical issues</strong>: PV/ET patients face thrombosis and
microvascular symptoms from thick, hypercellular blood. PMF patients
develop anemia, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and can progress
to acute myeloid leukemia in ~10–20% of cases.</li>
<li><strong>Current therapy</strong>: Phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, pegylated
interferon, and JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib, fedratinib, momelotinib)
temper counts and cytokine signaling but rarely clear the malignant
clone.</li>
<li><strong>Primary endpoints in trials</strong>: PV/ET programs usually
target composite endpoints like complete hematologic response
(hematocrit &lt;45% without phlebotomy, platelets &lt;400k, leukocytes
&lt;10k) plus thrombosis-free survival. PMF studies rely on &gt;=35%
spleen volume reduction (SVR35) by MRI/CT at week 24 and &gt;=50%
improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS) using the Myelofibrosis Symptom
Assessment Form.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prelude’s selective JAK2 JH2 inhibitors and CALR-targeted degraders
attempt to shut off these mutant circuits more precisely than today’s
nonselective JAK blockers, which is why the street views them as
potential first-in-class assets.</p>
