# Using ROS1 on macOS
I've been playing with Lidar-Inertial Odometry lately and a good chunk of time was spent learning how to use ROS1 on macOS. The main traps to avoid are

- Trying to build ROS1 from source. Most of the dependencies are outdated and extremly hard to install
- Trying to use docker + (VNC / X-Server). Spent a lot of time getting really obscure errors.
