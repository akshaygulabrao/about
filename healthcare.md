17.6 % of the GDP was health spending in 2023. Medicare spent 8.1 % and Medicaid spent 7.9 %. In all, health spending was **$4.9 trillion**, or **$14,570 per person**[^4]. In 2023, the federal government spent **$848 billion** on healthcare[^1]. For some context, the US government makes about **$4.67 trillion** in revenue as a combination of income tax, social security and medicare taxes, and corporate taxes[^2]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)

An unintended consequence of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is the monotonically increasing healthcare spending due to all parties acting rationally. Branning et al.[^3] succinctly explains the cycle of misaligned incentives:

- **Patients** spend as little as possible out-of-pocket; relies on 3rd-party payers for the majority of healthcare costs.
- **Providers** need to earn enough income to pay back student loans and justify the time and effort invested in patient care.
- **Health insurers** generate more in revenue than the company will spend on medical care for members.
- **Pharmacy Benefit Managers** collect service fees and earn a percentage of savings generated on behalf of customers.
- **Government** spends as little taxpayer money as possible while providing access to care for America's most vulnerable populations.
- **Pharmaceutical manufacturers** must generate enough income to earn a profit after recouping R&D and marketing costs.

[^1] **Medicare** is a federal health insurance for people 65 and older. **Medicaid** is designed to meet the needs of low-income individuals and families.
