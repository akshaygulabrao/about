<h1>Leveraging Subject Matter Expert Speech-to-Text Models as a Novel Alpha Generation Strategy in Financial Markets</h1>

<section id="abstract">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The increasing sophistication of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies has opened new frontiers for information extraction and alpha generation in financial markets. This paper explores the potential of using speech-to-text models from subject matter experts (SMEs) as a unique source of investment insights and potential market alpha. By systematically analyzing expert discourse, investors can potentially uncover nuanced information not readily available through traditional financial reporting mechanisms.</p>

<section id="introduction">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Financial markets have traditionally relied on structured data sources such as financial statements, press releases, and market reports. However, the advent of advanced NLP technologies presents an opportunity to extract valuable insights from less conventional information sources, particularly expert speech.</p>
    
    <p>This study aims to investigate the potential of using speech-to-text models from subject matter experts as a novel approach to generating investment alpha, exploring both the methodological framework and potential implementation strategies.</p>
    
    <p>Traditional financial theory suggests that superior investment returns (alpha) can be achieved by accessing and interpreting information more effectively than market participants. Speech-to-text models from SMEs represent a potential mechanism for reducing information asymmetry.</p>
