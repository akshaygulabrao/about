<p>Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR) has a drug named Deramiocel (CAP-1002)
to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It’s currently in Phase 3 and they
are due to release data in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Martin doesn’t think the drug works.</p>
<p>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a severe X-linked recessive disorder
caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes a structural
cytoskeletal protein in muscle cells named
<strong>dystrophin</strong>.</p>
<p>Skeletal muscles turn nerve signals into force by sliding filaments
inside long multinucleated fibers. Force travels both along fibers to
tendons and laterally into the surrounding matrix. Dystrophin sits at
the membrane, anchoring the inside (actin) to the outside (extracellular
matrix) to protect the cell during contraction.</p>
<p>Each muscle is actually a hierarchy of tissues. The largest group is
the whole muscles, which are bundles of fascicles wrapped in
<strong>epimysium</strong>. Each fascicle contains a bundle of muslce
fibers wrapped in <strong>perimysium</strong>. Each muscle fiber is a
single long cell with many nuclei. The membrane is called the
<strong>sarcolemma</strong>. <strong>Myofibril</strong> is parallel
contractile cables inside fibers. <strong>Sarcomere</strong> are
repeating units between <strong>Z-disks</strong>, which is where
contraction happens.</p>
<p>In the sarcomere, there are two types of filaments: a thin filament
made of <strong>actin</strong>, and a thick filament made of
<strong>myosin</strong>.</p>
