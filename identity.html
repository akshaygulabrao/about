<h1 id="im-a-mediocre-writer">I’m a mediocre writer</h1>
<p>Every time I write a sentence, someone better can trivially improve
it with more accurate words, get to the point faster, or surface a more
nuanced perspective. After hours of effort I still produce sub-standard
results. I do work hard enough; I just don’t get better. I have been
trying for a very long time to become a better writer, but it was never
easy, and I’m starting to believe I will never be good at it. The same
helpless feeling probably exists in other fields. Programming, for
example, was never really hard for me. When I tutor others I have to
fake sympathy, because I simply don’t feel the struggle they describe.
People think ChatGPT replaced coders; in reality it just made good
programmers 10× more efficient than bad ones. ChatGPT didn’t close the
gap between the rich and the poor—it’s extending it.</p>
<p>I used to assume academia was immune to this illusion. Then I
realized why the “growth mindset” is so prevalent there: you can’t get
honest feedback from people you pay. Professors won’t tell a student,
“You’re just not wired for this,” because their salaries depend on
keeping that student enrolled.</p>
<p>Social media amplifies the same distortion. You only see exceptional
people, and they make success look effortless, as if it were accessible
with just a little more effort. The illusion shatters the moment you
actually try to replicate their results. Beneath the surface there’s a
silent majority who are better than I am in many ways and still go
unrecognized because even they aren’t good enough to be among the truly
exceptional. Accepting my own mediocrity is painful. I’m becoming
shocked at how average I am in life. I’m better at math than writing,
but I wouldn’t say I’m good at math; if I were, I would have taken the
AMC and done well. Instead, at 25 I can barely scrape 40 % on the AMC
12—a test precocious fifteen-year-olds ace.</p>
<p>Still, writing isn’t worthless for me. Unlike trading stocks, it
isn’t zero-sum. My thoughts contribute to society, I think. When I write
about personal things, reading my work is the closest another person can
come to being me. Even if the prose is clunky and the sentences are out
of order, the record of an ordinary mind is still a record of a mind,
and that alone justifies the effort.</p>
