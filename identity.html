<h1 id="ill-always-be-a-mediocre-writer">I’ll always be a mediocre
writer</h1>
<p>A few youtube videos sparked this article. <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I used to think that I was just
unlucky. That one day, everyone will understand my true potential and
the opportunities that I so rightfully deserve will come my way. I used
to think I was better than my current situation. <em>The stock price is
wrong and everyone will soon agree.</em></p>
<p>I worked in Machine Learning for a few years before I got laid off
and started studying for this nursing degree. I used to hold on to this
illusion that I’m just unlucky right now, rather than the fact I was
<em>extremely lucky</em> a few years ago. In an attempt to restart the
economy after COVID, the US government lowered interest rates to nearly
0% allowing people take wildly speculative risks, making software
engineering a highly lucrative field. <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I was manipulated by society into thinking I’m smart enough. There’s
a huge “growth mindset” belief pervasive in universities due to the flow
of money. You can’t get answers from people that you pay. When people
pay tuition to a university, professors have no incentive to say “You
just aren’t wired for this”. They aren’t forced to stake their words
with money. The people feeding you hope have no incentive to tell you
the truth, god forbid you stop paying them tuition. Scott Alexander
explains this much more eloquently than I ever can. <a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The thing is, I would still classify myself as a good programmer.
However, markets around software engineering are hyper-efficient due to
the low barrier to entry. A smart 15 year old <strong>will</strong> take
your job. Government regulation adds considerable friction to market
efficiency, making healthcare an extremely profitable business.</p>
<p>Social media amplifies the same distortion. You only see exceptional
people, and they make success look effortless, as if it were accessible
with just a little more effort. The illusion shatters the moment you
actually try to replicate their results. Beneath the surface there’s a
silent majority who are better than I am in many ways and still go
unrecognized because even they aren’t good enough to be among the truly
exceptional. Accepting my own mediocrity is painful. I’m becoming
shocked at how average I am in life. I’m better at math than writing,
but I wouldn’t say I’m good at math; if I were, I would have taken the
AMC and done well. Instead, at 25 I can barely scrape 40 % on the AMC
12—a test precocious fifteen-year-olds ace.</p>
<p>Still, writing isn’t worthless for me. Unlike trading stocks, it
isn’t zero-sum. My thoughts contribute to society, I think. When I write
about personal things, reading my work is the closest another person can
come to being me. Even if the prose is clunky and the sentences are out
of order, the record of an ordinary mind is still a record of a mind,
and that alone justifies the effort.</p>
<h2 id="evidence-that-would-falsify-my-opinion">Evidence that would
falsify my opinion</h2>
<p>The children’s of doctors end up making the median income instead of
above-average income. Top NBA players / NFL players / marathon runners
are uniformly distributed with respect to race. Frontier research in
math coming from Africa.</p>
