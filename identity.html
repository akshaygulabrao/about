<h1 id="im-a-mediocre-writer">I’m a mediocre writer</h1>
<p>I suck at writing. I don’t want you to say that I don’t work hard
enough. I do work hard enough, and I get substandard results after hours
of efforts. Every time I write a sentence, someone better at writing can
trivially improve it with more accurate words, get quicker to the point,
or point out a more nuanced perspective. I will never be good at
writing. I have been trying for a very long time to become a better
writer, but it was just never easy.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say writing is a worthless activity for me to participate
in. Writing is not zero-sum, unlike trading in the stock market. My
thoughts contribute to society, I think. People can understand what it’s
like to be me. Reading my work is their attempt of being me, when I
write about personal things.</p>
<p>I don’t write about personal things often because I tend to think
life experiences are heavily based on IQ and attractiveness, so you can
derive completely different truths about life depending where on the
spectrum that you end up.</p>
<p>I am better at math than writing. I wouldn’t say that I’m
<em>good</em> at math. If I was <em>good</em> at math, I would have
taken the AMC and done well. Instead I can barely get past 40% on AMC 12
at the age of 25, a test that precocious math students ace at 15. I’m
becoming shocked at how mediocre I am in life.</p>
