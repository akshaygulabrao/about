# I'm a mediocre writer

Every time I write a sentence, someone better can trivially improve it with more accurate words, get to the point faster, or surface a more nuanced perspective.  After hours of effort I still produce sub-standard results.  I do work hard enough; I just don’t get better.  I have been trying for a very long time to become a better writer, but it was never easy, and I’m starting to believe I will never be good at it.
The same helpless feeling probably exists in other fields.  Programming, for example, was never really hard for me.  When I tutor others I have to fake sympathy, because I simply don’t feel the struggle they describe.  People think ChatGPT replaced coders; in reality it just made good programmers 10× more efficient than bad ones.  ChatGPT didn’t close the gap between the rich and the poor—it’s extending it.

I used to assume academia was immune to this illusion.  Then I realized why the “growth mindset” is so prevalent there: you can’t get honest feedback from people you pay.  Professors won’t tell a student, “You’re just not wired for this,” because their salaries depend on keeping that student enrolled.

Social media amplifies the same distortion.  You only see exceptional people, and they make success look effortless, as if it were accessible with just a little more effort.  The illusion shatters the moment you actually try to replicate their results.  Beneath the surface there’s a silent majority who are better than I am in many ways and still go unrecognized because even they aren’t good enough to be among the truly exceptional.
Accepting my own mediocrity is painful.  I’m becoming shocked at how average I am in life.  I’m better at math than writing, but I wouldn’t say I’m good at math; if I were, I would have taken the AMC and done well.  Instead, at 25 I can barely scrape 40 % on the AMC 12—a test precocious fifteen-year-olds ace.

Still, writing isn’t worthless for me.  Unlike trading stocks, it isn’t zero-sum.  My thoughts contribute to society, I think.  When I write about personal things, reading my work is the closest another person can come to being me.  Even if the prose is clunky and the sentences are out of order, the record of an ordinary mind is still a record of a mind, and that alone justifies the effort.
