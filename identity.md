# I'm a mediocre writer

I suck at writing. I don't want you to say that I don't work hard enough. I do work hard enough, and I get substandard results after hours of efforts. Every time I write a sentence, someone better at writing can trivially improve it with more accurate words, get quicker to the point, or point out a more nuanced perspective. I will never be good at writing. I have been trying for a very long time to become a better writer, but it was just never easy. 

I wouldn't say writing is a worthless activity for me to participate in. Writing is not zero-sum, unlike trading in the stock market. My thoughts contribute to society, I think. People can understand what it's like to be me. Reading my work is their attempt of being me, when I write about personal things. 

I don't write about personal things often because I tend to think life experiences are heavily based on IQ and attractiveness, so you can derive completely different truths about life depending where on the spectrum that you end up. 

I am better at math than writing. I wouldn't say that I'm *good* at math. If I was *good* at math, I would have taken the AMC and done well. Instead I can barely get past 40% on AMC 12 at the age of 25, a test that precocious math students ace at 15. I'm becoming shocked at how mediocre I am in life. 

On social media, you only see exceptional people. You only pay attention to exceptional people. The things is, exceptional people seem so nearly similar to you if you just "try" a little harder. They make it look effortless, offering an illusion of accessibility. However, the illusion quickly gets shattered when attempting to replicate their success. 

There's a silent majority of people that are better than me in many ways that still don't get recognized for their gifts because even *they* aren't good enough to be among the truly excpetional people. Of course on social media, the only people that you see are the exceptional people.

It's entirely possible that I gave up on algorithmic trading and machine learning too early. A completely valid criticism of my attempts would be I made my markets to vast too early and never ended up being the best at anything. Should I go back to weather betting then and focus on algorithmic execution? I don't know the answer. Should I work on my voice recognition / voice cloning project again? I don't know the answer. 

I have dedicated over 1000 hours too becoming "good" enough at weather betting that I'm profitable. 100 more hours of research definitely won't hurt. I'm going to try documenting everything as if I was publishing a paper at the end of 100 hours. It's a research project in and of itself.
