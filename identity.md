# I'll always be a mediocre writer

Saying positive things is a cheap signal. Things like "don't give up" or "you can do it", are very cheap signals to tell someone regardless of whether or not its a lie. 

I'm not a good writer. Good writers have significantly higher quality/effort ratios. My brain just doesn't come up with diverse and nice sentences as easily as others. Everyone has always told me that I can get better at writing if I practice.
