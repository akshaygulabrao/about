# I'm a mediocre writer

I suck at writing. I don't want you to say that I don't work hard enough. I do work hard enough, and I get substandard results after hours of efforts. Every time I write a sentence, someone better at writing can trivially improve it with more accurate words, get quicker to the point, or point out a more nuanced perspective. I will never be good at writing. I have been trying for a very long time to become a better writer, but it was just never easy. 

I wouldn't say writing is a worthless activity for me to participate in. Writing is not zero-sum, unlike trading in the stock market. My thoughts contribute to society, I think. People can understand what it's like to be me. Reading my work is their attempt of being me, when I write about personal things. 

I don't write about personal things often because I tend to think life experiences are heavily based on IQ and attractiveness, so you can derive completely different truths about life depending where on the spectrum that you end up. 

I am better at math than writing. I wouldn't say that I'm *good* at math. If I was *good* at math, I would have taken the AMC and done well. Instead I can barely get past 40% on AMC 12 at the age of 25, a test that precocious math students ace at 15. I'm becoming shocked at how mediocre I am in life.
