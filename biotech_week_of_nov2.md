## Overview

This notebook-style post will collect notable readouts, FDA actions, and financing events for the trading week starting Monday, November 3. I will keep the sections below short and link out to individual company notes (for example, [CAPR](./capr.html)) when deeper context is already written.

## Weekly Calendar

| Date | Catalyst | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Mon Nov 3 | _Placeholder_ | Outline key earnings calls, advisory committee meetings, or conference presentations. |
| Wed Nov 5 | _Placeholder_ | Jot down midweek clinical updates to watch. |
| Fri Nov 7 | _Placeholder_ | Summarize option expirations or data drops expected into the close. |

## Companies on Deck

- **Late-stage trials**: Draft commentary for the most mature catalysts (e.g., Phase 3 data, HSR expirations).
- **Small/micro caps**: Capture quick thesis reminders, share counts, and liquidity notes.
- **Follow-ups**: Link bullet points back to prior writeups once they exist (CAPR, SPRB, etc.).

## Notes To Add

- Valuation snapshot template (EV, cash, burn, runway).
- Standard language on macro drivers (rates, risk appetite) for the start of the week.
- Reminder to revisit watchlist after each close and append any after-hours news.
