## Prelude Therapeutics(NASDAQ:PRLD)

Two novel programs for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).
- selective JAK2V617F JH2 inhibitors.
- CALR-targeted degrader antibody conjugates (DACs)

Market treats them as highly differentiated, first-in-class approaches for the potential to transform MPN treatment. 

- **Big picture**: MPNs are clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells where a single mutant progenitor keeps producing too many mature myeloid cells (red cells, platelets, or granulocytes). The cells still differentiate, so the disease looks “proliferative” rather than “blastic” like acute leukemia.
- **Canonical subtypes**: Polycythemia vera (PV) causes erythrocytosis, essential thrombocythemia (ET) drives thrombocytosis, and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) scars the marrow so blood formation shifts to the spleen/liver. Chronic myeloid leukemia is technically an MPN but is typically discussed separately because of BCR–ABL.
- **Molecular drivers**: ~95% of PV and ~60% of ET/PMF cases harbor the JAK2 V617F mutation; others have MPL (thrombopoietin receptor) or calreticulin (CALR) mutations. All of these keep the JAK–STAT pathway switched on without cytokine ligand binding.
- **Clinical issues**: PV/ET patients face thrombosis and microvascular symptoms from thick, hypercellular blood. PMF patients develop anemia, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and can progress to acute myeloid leukemia in ~10–20% of cases.
- **Current therapy**: Phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, pegylated interferon, and JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib, fedratinib, momelotinib) temper counts and cytokine signaling but rarely clear the malignant clone.
- **Primary endpoints in trials**: PV/ET programs usually target composite endpoints like complete hematologic response (hematocrit <45% without phlebotomy, platelets <400k, leukocytes <10k) plus thrombosis-free survival. PMF studies rely on >=35% spleen volume reduction (SVR35) by MRI/CT at week 24 and >=50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS) using the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form.

Prelude’s selective JAK2 JH2 inhibitors and CALR-targeted degraders attempt to shut off these mutant circuits more precisely than today’s nonselective JAK blockers, which is why the street views them as potential first-in-class assets.

## Terns Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ:TERN)

TERN-701 - (CARDINAL) shows 64% MMR achievement by 24 weeks against Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) to be shared at ASH on December 8th, 2025.

- **Mechanism**: TERN-701 is an allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitor designed to bind the myristoyl pocket, similar to Novartis’ asciminib but with medicinal tweaks intended to improve exposure and minimize P-gp efflux. Because it targets a different site than ATP-competitive TKIs, it retains activity against the common resistance mutations (excluding T315I) and pairs well with standard TKIs without overlapping toxicities.
- **Patient setting**: CARDINAL is enrolling chronic-phase CML patients who have failed ≥2 prior TKIs or cannot tolerate them. This is a refractory population where many patients hover around 20–30% major molecular response (MMR, BCR-ABL1 ≤0.1% on the International Scale) after 24 weeks when treated with currently approved options.
- **Data significance**: A 64% MMR rate at 24 weeks nearly doubles the historical bar for this line of therapy. Hitting MMR quickly is correlated with long-term progression-free survival and the potential to achieve deeper responses (MR^4, MR^4.5) needed for eventual treatment-free remission.
- **Competitive positioning**: Asciminib posted ~25–37% MMR at week 24 in the ASCEMBL study (after ≥2 TKIs), so TERN-701’s preliminary signal could support a best-in-class narrative if safety remains clean. Differentiation hinges on durability, resistance profile, and combination data, but the top-line number alone is enough to put TERN on investors’ radar heading into ASH.
- **Next steps**: Dose-expansion data at ASH should clarify response durability, cytopenia rates, and activity in T315I-mutant disease. Watch for any hint of combination cohorts with ponatinib/dasatinib, as the company has telegraphed that as a strategy to move earlier in the treatment paradigm.

Stock closed up 70%. 

## Rein Therapeutics (NASDAQ: RNTX)

Their drug LTI-O3 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), lifted the full clinical hold after the trial addressed all concerns. 

Stock went up 12%. 

## Sarepta (NASDAQ: SRPT)

Completed its Phase 3 ESSENCE trial for AMONDYS 45 and VYONDYS 53, both against Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Primary endpoint missed statistical significance. 

### What “missing statistical significance” means

- **Regulatory shorthand**: Before a trial starts, the protocol defines a primary endpoint and a statistical test (e.g., two-sided p<0.05). If the observed treatment effect produces a p-value above that threshold, the endpoint is considered “not statistically significant,” meaning the null hypothesis (no true treatment effect) cannot be rejected at the agreed confidence level.
- **Practical implication**: Even if numerical improvements favor the drug, regulators treat the study as negative for that endpoint. Sponsors can still explore secondary endpoints or subgroup signals, but they usually need another adequately powered trial to convince FDA/EMA.
- **Common causes**: Smaller-than-expected effect size, higher variability, missing data, or protocol deviations can erode statistical power. Understanding which factor drove the miss guides whether the program is salvageable (e.g., refine patient selection) or fundamentally impaired.

## uniQure (NASDAQ: QURE)

- **Regulatory surprise**: During a late October pre-BLA meeting, FDA reportedly walked back its prior guidance that Phase I/II AMT-130 data benchmarked to an external natural-history cohort could be sufficient for an accelerated-approval filing in Huntington’s disease. Without that agreement, the company no longer has a clear path to file, pushing the timing of any BLA submission into limbo.
- **Why it matters**: AMT-130 holds Breakthrough Therapy and RMAT designations (granted April 2025 and May 2024, respectively) precisely because early data versus natural-history controls suggested disease stabilization. FDA’s shift implies the agency wants either a randomized study or additional evidence (e.g., biomarker/surrogate validation) before green-lighting a filing, raising the development bar for all gene therapies that rely on external controls.
- **Next steps**: uniQure expects formal meeting minutes within 30 days and plans urgent follow-up discussions to salvage an accelerated pathway. In parallel it will engage EU and UK regulators, but absent a clear FDA path, investor focus turns to whether AMT-130 must run a longer Phase III-style trial—something that could add years and hundreds of millions in cost.
- **Investor takeaway**: Shares were already under pressure after the hemophilia franchise transition; this new uncertainty prolongs the “wait for clarity” period and refocuses attention on the company’s cash runway and secondary pipeline (temporal lobe epilepsy, ALS, Fabry) for value support.

## Alvotech (NASDAQ: ALVO)

- **Regulatory setback**: FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for AVT05, the company’s proposed biosimilar to Johnson & Johnson’s Simponi/Simponi Aria (golimumab). The letter cites “unresolved deficiencies” from the July 2025 inspection of Alvotech’s Reykjavik manufacturing site. Until those issues are cleared, AVT05 cannot receive approval—pushing out the company’s shot at first-to-market status versus other Simponi biosimilars.
- **Manufacturing status**: The Reykjavik facility can continue supplying already-approved products, but output for new submissions is constrained while remediation work is underway. That means launch inventory for AVT05 (and future biosimilars) will remain limited until the FDA reinspects and lifts the observations.
- **Financial guidance cut**: Management lowered 2025 revenue guidance to $570–$600 million (from $700M+) and EBITDA to $130–$150 million. The reduction reflects slower production, qualification batches dedicated to remediation, and added capex/consulting to satisfy the FDA. Lower near-term cash generation also heightens the need for additional financing if the CRL drags deep into 2026.
- **Market reaction**: Shares dropped 34% to $5.03 as investors reassessed the timeline for AVT05 and the broader manufacturing narrative. Clearing the FDA findings quickly is now the key catalyst; until then, the stock is likely to trade on inspection updates rather than fundamentals.

## TScan Therapeutics (NASDAQ: TCRX)

- **Regulatory progress**: The company secured FDA alignment on the pivotal trial design for TSC-101, its lead T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy targeting minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1 in post-transplant AML/MDS relapse. Alignment on the control arm, conditioning intensity, and manufacturing release criteria de-risks the path to a single registrational study once dose and schedule are finalized.
- **Portfolio reprioritization**: Management is pausing new enrollment in the solid tumor TCR programs and trimming ~30% of staff to stretch cash into 2H27. Resources now concentrate on the hematologic platform where the biology is more validated and the regulatory path clearer.
- **Solid tumor status**: The first patients have already been dosed, and the company still plans to share initial translational/clinical data in Q1 2026. Halting enrollment buys time to interpret those readouts before committing fresh capital.
- **Market reaction**: Shares fell 36% to $1.24. Investors appear concerned about dilution risk despite the extended runway, as well as the signal that solid tumor efforts are slower than hoped. Near-term catalysts rest on the pivotal-ready TSC-101 package and any early efficacy glimpses from the paused solid tumor cohort.

Stock currently trades at ~18 from ~23 before earnings.
