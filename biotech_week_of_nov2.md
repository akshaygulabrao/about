Two novel programs for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).
- selective JAK2V617F JH2 inhibitors.
- CALR-targeted degrader antibody conjugates (DACs)

Market treats them as highly differentiated, first-in-class approaches for the potential to transform MPN treatment. 

### Context: What are myeloproliferative neoplasms?

- **Big picture**: MPNs are clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells where a single mutant progenitor keeps producing too many mature myeloid cells (red cells, platelets, or granulocytes). The cells still differentiate, so the disease looks “proliferative” rather than “blastic” like acute leukemia.
- **Canonical subtypes**: Polycythemia vera (PV) causes erythrocytosis, essential thrombocythemia (ET) drives thrombocytosis, and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) scars the marrow so blood formation shifts to the spleen/liver. Chronic myeloid leukemia is technically an MPN but is typically discussed separately because of BCR–ABL.
- **Molecular drivers**: ~95% of PV and ~60% of ET/PMF cases harbor the JAK2 V617F mutation; others have MPL (thrombopoietin receptor) or calreticulin (CALR) mutations. All of these keep the JAK–STAT pathway switched on without cytokine ligand binding.
- **Clinical issues**: PV/ET patients face thrombosis and microvascular symptoms from thick, hypercellular blood. PMF patients develop anemia, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and can progress to acute myeloid leukemia in ~10–20% of cases.
- **Current therapy**: Phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, pegylated interferon, and JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib, fedratinib, momelotinib) temper counts and cytokine signaling but rarely clear the malignant clone.
- **Primary endpoints in trials**: PV/ET programs usually target composite endpoints like complete hematologic response (hematocrit <45% without phlebotomy, platelets <400k, leukocytes <10k) plus thrombosis-free survival. PMF studies rely on >=35% spleen volume reduction (SVR35) by MRI/CT at week 24 and >=50% improvement in Total Symptom Score (TSS) using the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form.

Prelude’s selective JAK2 JH2 inhibitors and CALR-targeted degraders attempt to shut off these mutant circuits more precisely than today’s nonselective JAK blockers, which is why the street views them as potential first-in-class assets.
