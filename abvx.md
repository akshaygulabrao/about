## Obefazimod

Obefazimod started off as an HIV drug and now is an Ulcerative Colitis (UC) drug [@camposLongLastingControl2015] [@tazi2010]. Then in 2017, it was discovered to have anti-inflammatory properties. [@Chebli2017] They used dextran sulfate sodium to cause colitis in mice, and then administered their drug ABX464. They measured efficicacy by tracking IL-6, TNFÎ± and MCP-1.

ABVX discovered the drug works by modulating a set of key genes, which likely is the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor that EQ discovered.
