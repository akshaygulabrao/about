# Automated Tax Filing?

I have this software idea where I should take a picture of relevant tax forms, and output them into a complete tax filing. I wonder who else started working on this. Moore has a repository that does all the math for you given that you enter all the values [^1]. mmacpherson has a more mature library that lets you enter a config and get numerical details [^2]. It's more focused on financial planning rather than the filing process itself. Habutax maintains another repo that seems to be even more mature, allowing you to write to a PDF [^3]. 

E-File actually kills this project, making it dead on arrival. I'll leave this here in case anyone else tries this project or "startup". It's far simpler to read your W-2, enter the taxes directly on the site than playing with another application. A custom solution for enterprises may still be viable.
