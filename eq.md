# Overview

Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptors (AHR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that modulates intestinal inflammation and gut health. When there is too much of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), it stimulates AHR impairing the intestinal epithelial barrier. The impaired epithelial barrier allows foreign molecules inside, stimulating the immune system.
