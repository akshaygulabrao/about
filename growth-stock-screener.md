All research starts with a ChatGPT overview, and then you start going down the list of sources. The data I need to collect is
- the important materials that run the world
- who exports them
- who imports them

Claude Haiku 4.5 organizes this by the following categories:

- energy
- metals & ores
- agricultural commodities
- chemicals & fertilizers
- rare & strategic materials

# Energy
The main materials in the energy sector are

- crude oil
- natural gas
- coal
- petroleum products

Crude oil are hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are used for energy because

- the C and H bond with oxygen to release lots of energy during combustion
- relatively little activation energy

Natural gas is methane CH~4~
