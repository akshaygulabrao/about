[Home](./index.html)

All research starts with a ChatGPT overview, and then you start going down the list of sources. The data I need to collect is
- the important materials that run the world
- who exports them
- who imports them

Claude Haiku 4.5 organizes this by the following categories:

- energy
- metals & ores
- agricultural commodities
- chemicals & fertilizers
- rare & strategic materials

# Energy
The main materials in the energy sector are:
- crude oil
- natural gas
- coal
- petroleum products

The materials mainly differ in their main use case. Crude oil after refinement is the main component of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and heavy fuel oil. Then its also used for petrochemical feedstocks like plastics, fertilizers, synthetic fibers and solvents.

The biggest category is crude oil. It's technically referred to as petroleum oils. 

## Crude Oil
Crude-oil is surprisingly diverse. 15 countries account for 86% of them. Format: (Country: oil in us dollars)
