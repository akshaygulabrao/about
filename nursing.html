<h1 id="why-i-left-computer-vision-to-pursue-nursing">Why I left
Computer Vision to Pursue Nursing</h1>
<p>I majored in Computer Engineering at UC Riverside in 2017. I
qualified for the BS + MS graduate program there, and ended up with a MS
in Computer Science in 2022. After that I worked for defense contractor
(that went out of business) building Automated Target Recognition
systems of military vehicles. I ended up getting laid off in October
2024 and have been unemployed since.</p>
<p>The amount of jobs in Computer Science has reduced drastically from
2022 to 2025. <a
href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE">FRED
Data</a> for the following reasons (1) Badly enforced H1Bs immigration
rules allowing companies to hire immigrants for far cheaper costs than
US talent because they can use deportation to extort more hours out of
workers, (2) In 2022, the tax code forced all software developers to be
classified as capital instead of R&amp;D, meaning that they can’t be
deducted on taxes making them 30% more expensive, and (3) high interest
rates stifle risk-taking in all scenarios given the extremely high cost
of failure.</p>
<p>Now, the reason why I think nursing is a better choice is because of
the special budget treatment that Medicare gets in the <a
href="https://uscode.house.gov/">US Code</a>. In summary, when Congress
needs to make the budget work, Medicare is protected, allowing only a 4%
cut max. Even during the 4% cut, slightly I contemplated becoming a
doctor (assuming I’m smart enough to become one), but am unable to make
the discounted cashflows work in my favor due to the high CA state tax
rate. I feel like nursing provides a high return relative to the risk
(of tuition).</p>
<p>There’s also another reason why I’m quiting computer vision: I’m a
mediocre writer. Now that AI has significantly reduced the cost to test
ideas, the frontier of research is now around being able to write read
research efficiently.</p>
