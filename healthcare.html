    In 2023, the federal government spent $848 billion on healthcare<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. For some context, the US government makes about $4.67 trillion in revenue as a compination of income tax, social security and medicare taxes, and corporate taxes <a href="#gov_rev">[2]</a>. An unintended consequence of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is the monotonically increasing healthcare spending due to all parties acting rationally. Branning et. al. <a href="#ref3">[3]</a> succinctly explains the cycle of misaligned incentives: 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Patients</b> spend as little as possible out-of-pocket; relies on 3rd party payers for the majority of healthcare costs.</li>
        <li><b>Providers</b> spend as little as possible out-of-pocket; relies on 3rd party payers for the majority of healthcare costs.</li>
        <li><b>Health insurers</b>Generates more in revenue than the company will spend on medical care for members</li>
        <li><b>Phamacy Benefit Managers</b> collect service fees and earn a percentage of savings generated on behalf of customers</li>
        <li><b>Government</b> spends as little taxpayer money as possible while providing access to care for America's most vulnerable populations</li>
        <li><b>Pharmaceutical manufacturers</b> must generate enough income to earn a profit after recouping R&D and marketing costs</li>
    </ul>
    I think the biggest culprit amongst the misaligned incentives is the government. The goverment is intersted in
