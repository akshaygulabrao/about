    17.6% of the GDP was health spending in 2023. Medicare spent 8.1% and Medicaid spent 7.9%. In all, health spending was $4.9 trillion, or $14,570 per person.<a href="#ref4">[4]</a> <a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 2023, the federal government spent $848 billion on healthcare<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. For some context, the US government makes about $4.67 trillion in revenue as a compination of income tax, social security and medicare taxes, and corporate taxes. <a href="#gov_rev">[2]</a>. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28United_States%29

    An unintended consequence of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is the monotonically increasing healthcare spending due to all parties acting rationally. Branning et. al. <a href="#ref3">[3]</a> succinctly explains the cycle of misaligned incentives: 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Patients</b> spend as little as possible out-of-pocket; relies on 3rd party payers for the majority of healthcare costs.</li>
        <li><b>Providers</b> need to earn enough income to pay back student loans and justify the time and effort invested in patient care</li>
        <li><b>Health insurers</b> Generates more in revenue than the company will spend on medical care for members</li>
        <li><b>Phamacy Benefit Managers</b> collect service fees and earn a percentage of savings generated on behalf of customers</li>
        <li><b>Government</b> spends as little taxpayer money as possible while providing access to care for America's most vulnerable populations</li>
        <li><b>Pharmaceutical manufacturers</b> must generate enough income to earn a profit after recouping R&D and marketing costs</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Old people are the biggest tax on the economy. </p>

    <sup><a id="footnote1" href="#footnote1-ref">1</a></sup>  <b>Medicare</b> is a federal health insurance 65 and older. <b>Medicaid</b> is designed to meet the needs of low-income individuals and families.
